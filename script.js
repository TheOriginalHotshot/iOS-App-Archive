                description: "This version of Bowman is better than all previous versions.\n\nIf you wish to play the original game, simply turn off the Wind, Wall and Fatigue features within the game settings.\n\nThis latest version has it all. It has many options which you can turn on or off depending on how challenging you want it to be.\n\nBowman is a highly addictive classical game. Even if you've never heard of it before, play it just once and you'll be hooked.\n\nThe object of the game is to shoot arrows at your opponent and kill them before they kill you. It's a battle against your opponent to see who can accurately judge the angle and strength of the shot to make the arrow land on your opponents body.\n\nA head shot inflicts the most damage while a shot in the chest takes second place. Everywhere else on the opponents body inflicts less damage.\n\nTo shoot your bow, simply drag your finger across the screen and you'll be presented with a trajectory plus angle and strength (power) information. Release your finger to release the bow.\n\nYou can play Bowman against the iPhone or against a friend.\n\nTo make it even more entertaining, we have also included a bird shooting game. You'll have to shoot as many birds as you can within 3 minutes and then let your friend try the same. Hopefully, you will have shot more birds than your friend.\n\nThousands and thousands of people play Bowman online every day and now you can enjoy a better version of it on the iPhone. It really is highly addictive.\n\n**Lentrica Software has also released another simple yet highly addictive game - Escapa**",

It's not too hard, but challenging.\n\nHINT: This is not a simple process of elimination. It's much simpler!\n\nIt's amazing and it will give you hours of fun with your friends.\n\nDon't worry. This is not a kind of dark art. Try it... \"Avada Kedavra!\"\n\nNote: \"Guess My Age - Math Magic\" can also guess any number from 1-99",

Bring your games into the 21st century and be the envy of everyone at your next game night.\n\nIt all animates beautifully. Sand piles up, turning on the side will pause and all the sand pours to the side.\n\nFlipping instantly resets, so you're ready for the next round in your game without waiting.\n\nAdvantages:\n+ Adjustable; pick the length of your timer to suit the game.\n+ Quick Reset; just flip it over to reset the timer. No more waiting while the sand trickles from one bulb to another.\n+ Sound and Vibration; a buzzer and vibrating means you'll never miss when time is up. With an old sand timer, if nobody was watching closely, one team could get more time unfairly.*\n+ Change the look of your hourglass, from elegant to classic to silly.\n+ Silica, which could be used to build more iPhones, is not wasted!\n\n* Note that vibration features require iPhone and don't work on the iPod touch",

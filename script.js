                description: "This version of Bowman is better than all previous versions.\n\nIf you wish to play the original game, simply turn off the Wind, Wall and Fatigue features within the game settings.\n\nThis latest version has it all. It has many options which you can turn on or off depending on how challenging you want it to be.\n\nBowman is a highly addictive classical game. Even if you've never heard of it before, play it just once and you'll be hooked.\n\nThe object of the game is to shoot arrows at your opponent and kill them before they kill you. It's a battle against your opponent to see who can accurately judge the angle and strength of the shot to make the arrow land on your opponents body.\n\nA head shot inflicts the most damage while a shot in the chest takes second place. Everywhere else on the opponents body inflicts less damage.\n\nTo shoot your bow, simply drag your finger across the screen and you'll be presented with a trajectory plus angle and strength (power) information. Release your finger to release the bow.\n\nYou can play Bowman against the iPhone or against a friend.\n\nTo make it even more entertaining, we have also included a bird shooting game. You'll have to shoot as many birds as you can within 3 minutes and then let your friend try the same. Hopefully, you will have shot more birds than your friend.\n\nThousands and thousands of people play Bowman online every day and now you can enjoy a better version of it on the iPhone. It really is highly addictive.\n\n**Lentrica Software has also released another simple yet highly addictive game - Escapa**",

Bring your games into the 21st century and be the envy of everyone at your next game night.\n\nIt all animates beautifully. Sand piles up, turning on the side will pause and all the sand pours to the side.\n\nFlipping instantly resets, so you're ready for the next round in your game without waiting.\n\nAdvantages:\n+ Adjustable; pick the length of your timer to suit the game.\n+ Quick Reset; just flip it over to reset the timer. No more waiting while the sand trickles from one bulb to another.\n+ Sound and Vibration; a buzzer and vibrating means you'll never miss when time is up. With an old sand timer, if nobody was watching closely, one team could get more time unfairly.*\n+ Change the look of your hourglass, from elegant to classic to silly.\n+ Silica, which could be used to build more iPhones, is not wasted!\n\n* Note that vibration features require iPhone and don't work on the iPod touch",

Ever thought of slapping some wheels on a giant piece of fruit and taking it for a spin? How about racing around in a turtle shell? Why not go a step further and race around in a fruity tropical drink, umbrella and all. If you would rather be the big bully on the road, why not ride around in big heavy log or a volcano powered lump of rock? We did not forget our traditionalist with a sleek powder keg powered drag racer and Tiki Bobby’s take on what a traditional kart should be.\n\nGo deep into the world of Lonlo’s Volcano like never before. Enjoy the vistas as you barrel down the raceways of 15 fun filled tracks. Hold on tight to your seat as you encounter death defying jumps, spiral through corkscrew turns, speed through boost pads, and go full speed through gravity defying loopedy loops.\n\nSnag a power up pineapple and shuffle through the available gifts to torture your opponents. Send a fireball right up the tailpipe of that guy who cut you off. Plop a puddle of oil or a big glob of goopy tar to discourage the person tailgating you. Fire off a mighty missile to plow its way through the competition. Drop off a mine to create a waiting danger zone. Swipe another drivers kit to anger him then send him to into a rage as you use the item of destruction on him instead. You can even be awarded an extra punch of nitro booster.\n\nBullet points -\n\n8 karts\n15 tracks\nBoosts\nRockets\nLand Mines\nFireballs\nOil slicks\nSticky Tar\nFast paced\nSprings\n3 Levels of difficulty and speed\nEach Kart has its own handling and abilities - Acceleration, Top Speed, Traction, Boost power, Off-road ability.",

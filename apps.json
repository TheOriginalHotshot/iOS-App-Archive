        "description": "Dropoly is an exciting remake of BlockOut! (tm), the most popular 3D version of the all-too-famous brick-dropping game Tetris (tm).\n\nDropoly allows you to play on a variable depth pit where polycubes drop at increasing speeds. The game has three predefined game modes for quick occasional gamers (Flat Fun, 3D Mania, and Out-of-Control) as well as a full customizable mode for professional puzzlers. You can save your game state and continue later, listen to you iPod music while playing, and Dropoly saves and restores your options automatically.\n\nUsing an innovative control interface and faithfully designed to replicate the original scoring rules of the 80's game, Dropoly will please both hard-core gamers that already know how to play as well as newcomers that never saw a 3D polycube game before.\n\nCan you drop that poly?\n\n--\n\nBlockout, originally licensed to California Dreams, is a registered U.S. trademark of Kadon Enterprises, Inc., a maker of physical polycubes. Tetris is a trademark of The Tetris Company. Inovaworks is not in any way affiliated with any of these two companies.",

        "description": "This version of Bowman is better than all previous versions.\n\nIf you wish to play the original game, simply turn off the Wind, Wall and Fatigue features within the game settings.\n\nThis latest version has it all. It has many options which you can turn on or off depending on how challenging you want it to be.\n\nBowman is a highly addictive classical game. Even if you've never heard of it before, play it just once and you'll be hooked.\n\nThe object of the game is to shoot arrows at your opponent and kill them before they kill you. It's a battle against your opponent to see who can accurately judge the angle and strength of the shot to make the arrow land on your opponents body.\n\nA head shot inflicts the most damage while a shot in the chest takes second place. Everywhere else on the opponents body inflicts less damage.\n\nTo shoot your bow, simply drag your finger across the screen and you'll be presented with a trajectory plus angle and strength (power) information. Release your finger to release the bow.\n\nYou can play Bowman against the iPhone or against a friend.\n\nTo make it even more entertaining, we have also included a bird shooting game. You'll have to shoot as many birds as you can within 3 minutes and then let your friend try the same. Hopefully, you will have shot more birds than your friend.\n\nThousands and thousands of people play Bowman online every day and now you can enjoy a better version of it on the iPhone. It really is highly addictive.\n\n**Lentrica Software has also released another simple yet highly addictive game - Escapa**",

Bring your games into the 21st century and be the envy of everyone at your next game night.\n\nIt all animates beautifully. Sand piles up, turning on the side will pause and all the sand pours to the side.\n\nFlipping instantly resets, so you're ready for the next round in your game without waiting.\n\nAdvantages:\n+ Adjustable; pick the length of your timer to suit the game.\n+ Quick Reset; just flip it over to reset the timer. No more waiting while the sand trickles from one bulb to another.\n+ Sound and Vibration; a buzzer and vibrating means you'll never miss when time is up. With an old sand timer, if nobody was watching closely, one team could get more time unfairly.*\n+ Change the look of your hourglass, from elegant to classic to silly.\n+ Silica, which could be used to build more iPhones, is not wasted!\n\n* Note that vibration features require iPhone and don't work on the iPod touch",

        "description": "FunRhyming is a Universal App, so it works with both iPhone and iPad.\n\nThis game provides many hours of enjoyment. Children are challenged to win \"jewels\" for successful completion of each level. After collecting enough jewels, they are rewarded with a bonus mini-game, allowing them to trace or color a picture, create sparkles on the screen, and pop bubbles. Your child will be so involved in achieving each goal, that they won't realize how much they are learning.\n\nBy matching rhyming words, this game helps children recognize common word patterns, and understand how the initial consonant, middle vowel, and ending consonant affect pronunciation. They will learn to distinguish between long and short vowel sounds, and they will learn to pronounce consonant combinations, such as \"ch\" and \"sh\". These are all important stepping stones to becoming a proficient reader.\n\nThis game is like having a private tutor to teach your child one on one.\n\nThis is the free version. We also have a paid version which is the same game with additional content.\n\nAbitalk is a member of Moms with Apps, a collaborative group of family-friendly developers seeking to promote quality apps for kids and families.\nRecommended Ages: 4-7\nCategories: Reading, Phonics, Vocabulary\n\nWhen you download and use this app, we don’t require you to provide any information nor do we collect any information from you or about you, your device, or your use of this app.\nThis app complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.",

Ever thought of slapping some wheels on a giant piece of fruit and taking it for a spin? How about racing around in a turtle shell? Why not go a step further and race around in a fruity tropical drink, umbrella and all. If you would rather be the big bully on the road, why not ride around in big heavy log or a volcano powered lump of rock? We did not forget our traditionalist with a sleek powder keg powered drag racer and Tiki Bobby’s take on what a traditional kart should be.\n\nGo deep into the world of Lonlo’s Volcano like never before. Enjoy the vistas as you barrel down the raceways of 15 fun filled tracks. Hold on tight to your seat as you encounter death defying jumps, spiral through corkscrew turns, speed through boost pads, and go full speed through gravity defying loopedy loops.\n\nSnag a power up pineapple and shuffle through the available gifts to torture your opponents. Send a fireball right up the tailpipe of that guy who cut you off. Plop a puddle of oil or a big glob of goopy tar to discourage the person tailgating you. Fire off a mighty missile to plow its way through the competition. Drop off a mine to create a waiting danger zone. Swipe another drivers kit to anger him then send him to into a rage as you use the item of destruction on him instead. You can even be awarded an extra punch of nitro booster.\n\nBullet points -\n\n8 karts\n15 tracks\nBoosts\nRockets\nLand Mines\nFireballs\nOil slicks\nSticky Tar\nFast paced\nSprings\n3 Levels of difficulty and speed\nEach Kart has its own handling and abilities - Acceleration, Top Speed, Traction, Boost power, Off-road ability.",

Each day we risk death for the rewards and thrills of our chosen path. We are the racers, the heroes of our war torn world. Our vehicles shield us, our weaponry brings forth our vengeance, the world is our playground, and the corporations that run things are a necessary evil. \nSet in a war-torn and steam-powered industrial world where your very survival depends any means necessary in a no-rules, high stakes, high impact, steam-powered death race. You'll need to choose and customize your vehicle like the 4-Wheel Armored Classic, Heavy Tank Tall Boy, Agile Delivery, 3-Wheel Scarab, Dozenberg, Drag Racer, Zeppelin, Rough Truckin', Brutal Wagon, or the 6-Wheel LG04-Ohzma; each with unique features and capabilities. You'll also need weapons and elemental powers because, let's face it: playing fair is just no fun. Teleport ahead of your enemies, engage force fields, blast your opponents energy with an EMP wave, turn the world upside down or create a gravity bubble with a Gravity Vortex, or deploy our most devastating weapons like missiles, chain guns, high-speed mines and tar, poison fields, fireballs, drone blimp-bombers, satellite ray beams, chainsaws, and vortex technology just to name a few. \nAs you race through your journey through the online tournament circuit, look for big sponsors to make more money but beware as corporations like A.R.B sponsors many racers and are suspected of fixing the races to seize power. Choose your side!\n\n- Customizable vehicles with 30 weapons/abilities\n- Unique physics engine allows for full range of control\n- Realtime Multiplayer modes against 6 players world wide or on your lan\n- Massive Online Tournaments \n- personalize your online experience with facebook\n- 3D\n- HD\n- Upgrade each vehicles armor, top speed, acceleration, control and hit points.\n- 15 tracks\n- 6 different power-ups\n- 5 circuits",

        "description": "Carryout Multiplications step by step \n\nThis Application enables you to solve multiplication problems step by step, just as you would do it on a sheet of paper. Being able to carry out the multiplication step by step is the key feature of this application. \n\nThe application surface area represents a worksheet that’s touch enabled. As you start to do the multiplication you touch areas on the screen to highlight it and then use the keypad to enter the numbers. The idea is to enable long multiplications where you go digit by digit line by line also entering any carry forwards to solve the problem. \n\n\nHow the application works \n\nWhen you start the application it presents a screen where you choose the type of multiplications you like to practice. You could choose number of digits that you want for multiplicand as well as the multiplier and also set the range for the numbers; also you could choose if you want the application to present numbers that would result in rounding. Once set, the application presents questions that are generated randomly using the above criteria. \n\nAs guidance, if the user is a kindergartener and wants to practice basic multiplication facts, you might choose to start with one digit and may set your multiplier limit to the same number say 4 to practice multiplying by 4 (see the screenshot below). As you start to get more comfortable with your basic one digit multiplications you could start to turn it up a notch by increasing the digits on the first number (multiplicand) and also introduce the rounding. \n\nIf the user is in higher grades and has basic multiplication facts squared away, he or she could start with multiple digits on the second number (multiplier) and you will be presented with the worksheet that will allow you to do multiline multiplications (see the screen shot below). \n\nPractice, Practice, Practice \n\nIsn’t that we have heard so many times about Math? Should I really have to carry my workbooks everywhere, isn’t it really so cumbersome to do your workbooks when you are in the car with your parents. With the fabulous technology in your hand you have this fabulous application that I am confident will provide you the tool that you are looking for to improve your grades and become more confident. \n\nFinally \n\nAs you can see this application doesn’t become obsolete after just one grade, it is something that you really want to keep with you for quite many years. \nI am very confident that this tool will prove to be a tool that will truly help you learning multiplications and give you the edge that you are looking for in your classroom. \n\n*****Testimonials***** \n\nThese are from my three testers for this application, \nMy 6 year old daughter says she has just moved to two digit level. \nI myself am having fun with four digit multiplication, what a great brain exercise. Didn’t know what the calculators and computers have done to my mathematical ability (grin).",

How long will you be able to stay in gator alley without being eaten by an alligator?\n\nThe object of the game is to drag your finger around the screen, avoiding the gators that are swimming in the swamp. The amount of gators will slowly increase and they will become smarter hunters (so you better be good at hiding).\n\nThe game displays your high score (how long you can survive in the swamp). Your life will slowly decrease from 100% to 0% as the gators touch you. Try to grab a frog and it will increase your life by 25%. Make sure not lift that finger up to early or you will drown!\n\n“Think Pac-man, but no mazes and whole lot more fun!”\n\n\"Gator Alley puts you in the pond with the alligators. You, the avatar, are swimming, moving to keep yourself alive.

        "description": "Nok Hockey is an electronic version of the real-life hockey board-game made by Carrom. The same game played in camps and schools around the world. This game is meant to replicate what it's like to play the board game. We limited the fancy special effects so that when you play Nok Hockey on your iPhone or iPad, it looks and feels like the real life board game.\n\nIt will test your shooting and angle skills as you try to find the correct angle and speed to shoot off the boards and score a goal! First one to 5 wins!\n\nPLAYING TIP: \nTO SHOOT: PUT YOUR FINGER BEHIND THE PUCK (not on it) AND SWIPE YOUR FINGER THROUGH THE PUCK IN THE DIRECTION YOU WANT IT TO TRAVEL.\n\nThere are 3 different playing modes of the game: \n1. Player vs. Player \n2. Player vs. Computer\n3. Shootout Mode\n\nIn the Player vs. Player mode, you can play hockey against someone else using the same device. But score quickly, because the first person to score 5 goals wins!\n\nIn the Player vs. Computer mode, you can select how good the Computer is: easy, intermediate, or difficult. But be careful, when you select a difficult computer opponent, the goals come quickly so make sure you can score quickly too! And also, the first to score 5 goals wins!\n\nIn the Shootout mode, you have the opportunity improve and test your shooting skills. The computer will randomly select 10 different shots on the board for you to shoot from. Your objective is to score as many of the 10 shots as possible. Then, play again to see if you can beat your score. \n\nAnd just a TIP, when taking a shot, be sure to put your finger BEHIND THE PUCK (not on the puck), and then with one motion, move your finger over and passed the puck. But find the right speed and correct angle. You will need these to be just right to score!!\n\nNOK HOCKEY by TNT APPS.....\nHE SHOOTS, HE SCORES!!!\nSHE SHOOTS, SHE SCORES!!!\n\nwww.tandtapps.com\ntandtapps@gmail.com",
